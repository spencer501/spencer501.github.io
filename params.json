Here you will find links to these projects and some of my thoughts on them.\r\n\r\n### 2016 General Election Campaign Spending\r\nIn this project my team and I explored the spending habits of the 2016 presidential candidates for each candidate, as well as compare their spending habits against each other\r\nCheck it out [here](https://spencer501.shinyapps.io/498f-final/)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
