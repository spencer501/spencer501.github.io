                    Metrics of Segregation - <em>Winter 2017</em>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    In an assignment on wrangling data in <em>Intro to Data Science (INFO 370)</em>, I computed various metrics of segregation across 14 cities. I found it particularly interesting how there is no definitive measure of segregation - different metrics each provide their own insights into the data. This assignment really showed how complex public health data can be, and the insight required to draw accurate conclusions from said data.

                    Kanye West Lyrics Database - <em>Fall 2016</em>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Created as a final group project in <em>Client-side Web Development (INFO 343)</em>, this web app makes use of React and Firebase to allow users to search for lyrics to every song by Kanye West. If the user logs in, they can even favorite a lines and view the most popular lyrics for every song.

                    Computational Astrophysics - <em>Spring 2016</em>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    In <em>Methods of Computational Astrophysics (ASTR 427)</em>, I explored how numerical problems are solved in the field of scientific computing. The emphasis on understanding performance optimizations and limitations gave me a new way of approaching programming problems. This class was also my first real experience with Python.

                </h3>             

                <p>
                    In this final project for <em>Technical Foundations of Informatics (INFO 201)</em>, my team and I analyzed the spending habits of the 2016 presidential candidates. We explored trends in each individual candidate, as well as comparing candidates to each other. This was my first experience collecting and manipulating a large set of data.

                <p>
                    In my first experience applying the principles of design thinking, my team and I prototyped an app with the purpose of increasing student academic performance. We did this by designing an easy platform to manage and use study groups in classes.
